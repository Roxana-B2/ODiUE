# Object Detection in an Urban Environment


## Project overview
Self driving cars act in a complex, dynamic environment where errors can have disastrous consequences. To safely navigate this environment a self-driving cars needs to perceive and understand its surrounding. In this respect, object localization and categorization are the most important tools available.

In this project, a Tensorflow object detection pipeline is trained on the [Waymo Open dataset](https://waymo.com/open/) for urban driving to detect other cars, cyclists and pedestrians.


## Set up
The project was developed using the Desktop environment provided in the Self Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree. In order to avoid the pre-installed Firefox from crashing when working on the notebooks of this project, upgrading Firefox to the latest version (sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get install firefox) is required.

To set-up the project locally see the 'Local Setup' section in the original task description at the end of this page.


## Dataset
The [Waymo Open dataset](https://waymo.com/open/) was used.  Further information on the structure of the data and on downloading it locally can be found in the original task description at the end of this page.

### Dataset analysis
The images were taken mainly in 2 different scenarios / locations: on the highway and in the cities. We have no outlier images for extremely rare scenarios such as driving in the desert with no cars around or around a corn field, where all of a sudden some human joggers could appear out of nowhere.

The images are relatively well varied in terms of weather conditions, sun lighting, time of the day, how busy the streets are with other cars etc.

All images contain cars. About a quarter of the images contain pedestrians in them, and very few contain bicycle riders. So there is an imbalance of classes occurences in the dataset as can be seen by this chart plotting the number of occurrences of the different classes on a randomly chosen subset:

<img src="images/EDA01.png">

The task for the algorithm was to classify the moving objects belonging in any of these 3 categories with the correct label and to represent them visually in the images surrounded within rectangular bounding boxes with edges of color red, blue and green respectively.

Some cars further away (either moving or parked, in well lit or dark photos) are not reliably detected as such, meaning they are either not recognised as cars or they are recognised or not depending on the image frame (in successive timestamps of same image).

Other moving objects such as vans or trucks for example are classified as cars also (they unfortunaltey do not have a separate label for this task). Other extraordinary vehicles like motorcycles, firefigther trucks or ambulances have not been spotted in the initial data exploration. Thus, no comment on how they are classified or whether these exist at all in the dataset can be made.

### Cross validation
The dataset is split into train (86 segment files), test (3 segment files) and evaluation (10 segment files) data. The default split is kept, since it seems to balance maximizing training examples while also ensuring a meaningful evaluation. In addition to this, keeping the default split increases the comparability of the results with other implementations.

## Training
### Reference experiment
The residual network model (Resnet) without additional augmentations was used for the first experiment. The results of the experiment can be seen below.

As can be seen, there is a significant gap in the localization loss between training and evaluation. This indicates overfitting of the location of the detection.


### Improve on the reference
To improve the performance of the model several augmentations of the model were performed.

In addition to the two already used augmentations (random_horizontal_flip and random_crop_image) the following ones where experimented with in the Explore augmenations notebook:
* random_black_patches
* random_adjust_brightness
* random_adjust_contrast
* random_jitter_boxes

The motiviation behind using random_adjust_brightness was the observation that most images in the dataset seem to be in clear conditions. By adjusting the brightness unusual weather conditions that typically affect the brightness should be better represented in the dataset.

It could be seen that in a lot of images a lot of object clusters were present:

To differentiate between these better random_adjust_contrast and random_jitter_boxes were used to emphasize the boundaries between them. Furthermore, random_black_patches was used to emphasize the resulting overlap of objects.

# Original Task Description

## Data

For this project, we will be using data from the [Waymo Open dataset](https://waymo.com/open/).

[OPTIONAL] - The files can be downloaded directly from the website as tar files or from the [Google Cloud Bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/waymo_open_dataset_v_1_2_0_individual_files/) as individual tf records. We have already provided the data required to finish this project in the workspace, so you don't need to download it separately.

## Structure

### Data

The data you will use for training, validation and testing is organized as follow:
```
/home/workspace/data/waymo
	- training_and_validation - contains 97 files to train and validate your models
    - train: contain the train data (empty to start)
    - val: contain the val data (empty to start)
    - test - contains 3 files to test your model and create inference videos
```
The `training_and_validation` folder contains file that have been downsampled: we have selected one every 10 frames from 10 fps videos. The `testing` folder contains frames from the 10 fps video without downsampling.
```
You will split this `training_and_validation` data into `train`, and `val` sets by completing and executing the `create_splits.py` file.


### Experiments
The experiments folder will be organized as follow:
```
experiments/
    - pretrained_model/
    - exporter_main_v2.py - to create an inference model
    - model_main_tf2.py - to launch training
    - reference/ - reference training with the unchanged config file
    - experiment0/ - create a new folder for each experiment you run
    - experiment1/ - create a new folder for each experiment you run
    - experiment2/ - create a new folder for each experiment you run
    - label_map.pbtxt
    ...
```

## Prerequisites

### Local Setup

For local setup if you have your own Nvidia GPU, you can use the provided Dockerfile and requirements in the [build directory](./build).

Follow [the README therein](./build/README.md) to create a docker container and install all prerequisites.

### Download and process the data

**Note:** ‚ÄùIf you are using the classroom workspace, we have already completed the steps in the section for you. You can find the downloaded and processed files within the `/home/workspace/data/preprocessed_data/` directory. Check this out then proceed to the **Exploratory Data Analysis** part.

The first goal of this project is to download the data from the Waymo's Google Cloud bucket to your local machine. For this project, we only need a subset of the data provided (for example, we do not need to use the Lidar data). Therefore, we are going to download and trim immediately each file. In `download_process.py`, you can view the `create_tf_example` function, which will perform this processing. This function takes the components of a Waymo Tf record and saves them in the Tf Object Detection api format. An example of such function is described [here](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/training.html#create-tensorflow-records). We are already providing the `label_map.pbtxt` file.

You can run the script using the following command:
```
python download_process.py --data_dir {processed_file_location} --size {number of files you want to download}
```

You are downloading 100 files (unless you changed the `size` parameter) so be patient! Once the script is done, you can look inside your `data_dir` folder to see if the files have been downloaded and processed correctly.

### Classroom Workspace

In the classroom workspace, every library and package should already be installed in your environment. You will NOT need to make use of `gcloud` to download the images.

## Instructions

### Exploratory Data Analysis

You should use the data already present in `/home/workspace/data/waymo` directory to explore the dataset! This is the most important task of any machine learning project. To do so, open the `Exploratory Data Analysis` notebook. In this notebook, your first task will be to implement a `display_instances` function to display images and annotations using `matplotlib`. This should be very similar to the function you created during the course. Once you are done, feel free to spend more time exploring the data and report your findings. Report anything relevant about the dataset in the writeup.

Keep in mind that you should refer to this analysis to create the different spits (training, testing and validation).


### Create the training - validation splits
In the class, we talked about cross-validation and the importance of creating meaningful training and validation splits. For this project, you will have to create your own training and validation sets using the files located in `/home/workspace/data/waymo`. The `split` function in the `create_splits.py` file does the following:
* create three subfolders: `/home/workspace/data/train/`, `/home/workspace/data/val/`, and `/home/workspace/data/test/`
* split the tf records files between these three folders by symbolically linking the files from `/home/workspace/data/waymo/` to `/home/workspace/data/train/`, `/home/workspace/data/val/`, and `/home/workspace/data/test/`

Use the following command to run the script once your function is implemented:
```
python create_splits.py --data-dir /home/workspace/data
```

### Edit the config file

Now you are ready for training. As we explain during the course, the Tf Object Detection API relies on **config files**. The config that we will use for this project is `pipeline.config`, which is the config for a SSD Resnet 50 640x640 model. You can learn more about the Single Shot Detector [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf).

First, let's download the [pretrained model](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/tf2/20200711/ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8.tar.gz) and move it to `/home/workspace/experiments/pretrained_model/`.

We need to edit the config files to change the location of the training and validation files, as well as the location of the label_map file, pretrained weights. We also need to adjust the batch size. To do so, run the following:
```
python edit_config.py --train_dir /home/workspace/data/train/ --eval_dir /home/workspace/data/val/ --batch_size 2 --checkpoint /home/workspace/experiments/pretrained_model/ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8/checkpoint/ckpt-0 --label_map /home/workspace/experiments/label_map.pbtxt
```
A new config file has been created, `pipeline_new.config`.

### Training

You will now launch your very first experiment with the Tensorflow object detection API. Move the `pipeline_new.config` to the `/home/workspace/experiments/reference` folder. Now launch the training process:
* a training process:
```
python experiments/model_main_tf2.py --model_dir=experiments/reference/ --pipeline_config_path=experiments/reference/pipeline_new.config
```
Once the training is finished, launch the evaluation process:
* an evaluation process:
```
python experiments/model_main_tf2.py --model_dir=experiments/reference/ --pipeline_config_path=experiments/reference/pipeline_new.config --checkpoint_dir=experiments/reference/
```

**Note**: Both processes will display some Tensorflow warnings, which can be ignored. You may have to kill the evaluation script manually using
`CTRL+C`.

To monitor the training, you can launch a tensorboard instance by running `python -m tensorboard.main --logdir experiments/reference/`. You will report your findings in the writeup.

### Improve the performances

Most likely, this initial experiment did not yield optimal results. However, you can make multiple changes to the config file to improve this model. One obvious change consists in improving the data augmentation strategy. The [`preprocessor.proto`](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/protos/preprocessor.proto) file contains the different data augmentation method available in the Tf Object Detection API. To help you visualize these augmentations, we are providing a notebook: `Explore augmentations.ipynb`. Using this notebook, try different data augmentation combinations and select the one you think is optimal for our dataset. Justify your choices in the writeup.

Keep in mind that the following are also available:
* experiment with the optimizer: type of optimizer, learning rate, scheduler etc
* experiment with the architecture. The Tf Object Detection API [model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md) offers many architectures. Keep in mind that the `pipeline.config` file is unique for each architecture and you will have to edit it.

**Important:** If you are working on the workspace, your storage is limited. You may to delete the checkpoints files after each experiment. You should however keep the `tf.events` files located in the `train` and `eval` folder of your experiments. You can also keep the `saved_model` folder to create your videos.


### Creating an animation
#### Export the trained model
Modify the arguments of the following function to adjust it to your models:

```
python experiments/exporter_main_v2.py --input_type image_tensor --pipeline_config_path experiments/reference/pipeline_new.config --trained_checkpoint_dir experiments/reference/ --output_directory experiments/reference/exported/
```

This should create a new folder `experiments/reference/exported/saved_model`. You can read more about the Tensorflow SavedModel format [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model).

Finally, you can create a video of your model's inferences for any tf record file. To do so, run the following command (modify it to your files):
```
python inference_video.py --labelmap_path label_map.pbtxt --model_path experiments/reference/exported/saved_model --tf_record_path /data/waymo/testing/segment-12200383401366682847_2552_140_2572_140_with_camera_labels.tfrecord --config_path experiments/reference/pipeline_new.config --output_path animation.gif
```
